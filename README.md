This is my final Python curse project  

Decided try to write a script with 5 types of sorting:
- Merge Sort, 
- Heap Sort, 
- BubbleSort
- Counting Sort
- Quick Sort

It sorts N-element sequence of natural numbers and returns in descending order.

Entry data to sort:
- given by user (N-element),
- random generated by script,
- from file.

You can test the speed of all five sorting algorithms by choosing option "T" in menu.
You will be given sorted numbers, time of running and fastest and slowest method.

Have fun.
